Step-by-Step Guide to Host Your Birthday Website on GitHub
I'll walk you through the process of hosting your birthday website on GitHub Pages. It's free and relatively simple!

Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
Go to GitHub.com

Click "Sign up" and create a free account

Verify your email address

Step 2: Create a New Repository
Once logged in, click the "+" icon in the top right corner

Select "New repository"

Name your repository: username.github.io (replace "username" with your GitHub username)

This specific naming convention is important for GitHub Pages

Make the repository public

Optionally add a description

Click "Create repository"

Step 3: Upload Your Website Files
In your new repository, click "Add file" → "Upload files"

Drag and drop your HTML file or click to choose it

If you have additional files (images, CSS, JS), upload them too

Add a commit message (like "Initial commit")

Click "Commit changes"

Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages
Go to your repository's "Settings" tab

Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section

Under "Source", select the "main" branch

Click "Save"

Wait a few minutes for GitHub to publish your site

Step 5: Access Your Website
Your site will be available at: https://username.github.io
(replace "username" with your GitHub username)

It might take up to 10 minutes for the site to become available

Optional: Using a Custom Domain
If you have a custom domain you'd like to use:

In your repository Settings → Pages

Add your custom domain in the "Custom domain" field

Configure your DNS settings with your domain registrar
